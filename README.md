## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a bit more about using flexbox, specifically centering an object. I found the basic way to do this, but kept struggling. The box would center horizontally, but not vertically. After some googling I found a forum post of someone struggling with the same issue and a solution to my problem. My element lacked height, so flexbox didn't know to center it. But when I added "height: 100vh;" it worked.

I'm unsure if I chose my sizing the correct way. I used the mobile size as my starting point and picked an inline-size in pixels based on that. I think it looks like it might be a little bit too small on my phone, but the design looks right compared to the design-images I got. Maybe there's a better way to do this.

I was unsure if I needed to add a section to my html, but concluded that since i needed a div anyway, it was probably fine without.

### Continued development

As this is one of my very first projects, I still have a lot to learn. I feel like I'm understanding the basic concepts of html and css, but I need to practice more to get it under my skin. I don't yet remember all the tags and properties that I've learned, so I keep having to look it up. But I suppose that's normal for a beginner.

I would like to learn more about responsive design. I don't know if my design should be different to be more accessible, but since it used the mobile size as a starting point, I assume it should be fine.

I want to learn more about semantic html to be certain that i use it correctly.

I want to learn to use flexbox and grid in more detail.
